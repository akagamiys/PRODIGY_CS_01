# Caeser Cipher Implementation

## Overview

This Python program illustrates the Caesar Cipher technique, a simple encryption method used to shift characters in a string by a specified number of positions. The program includes functions to both encrypt and decrypt messages.
How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each character in the input text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. 

For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. The program can handle uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and spaces.
Features


## Encryption: 

Shifts characters in the input text to produce an encoded message.

## Decryption: 

Shifts characters in the encoded message back to their original form.

## Handles Special Cases: 

Maintains spaces and shifts digits appropriately.

## Usage

Run the Program: Execute the Python script in your environment.
```bash
Choose an Option:
      Enter 1 for encryption.
      Enter 2 for decryption.
Input the String: Type the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
View the Result: The program will output the original and the processed text.
```
